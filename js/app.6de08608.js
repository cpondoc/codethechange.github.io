We hold each other and ourselves accountable for ensuring everything we do at Code the Change represents these values.\n\n## Growth\n\n- We learn from each other and our partners, and we enable others’ learning by sharing our skills, knowledge, and perspectives.\n- We support each other's growth by making space for each other, and embracing our own and each other’s mistakes as opportunities for growth.\n- We give constructive feedback kindly and receive it graciously.\n- We take time to reflect and improve.\n\n## Community\n\n- We respect, value, support, and cherish each other.\n- We welcome members of all backgrounds and abilities, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, body size, visible or invisible disability, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, or level of experience. We have no tolerance for discrimination on the basis of these characteristics, and we accept the responsibility to prevent harassment, abuse, and intimidation of any kind within our organization.\n- We cultivate empathy and kindness for each other, our partners, and the broader community.\n- We are honest and forthright with each other, our partners, and all others with whom we interact. We strive to operate transparently wherever possible.\n\n## Humility\n\n- We forge reciprocal relationships with our partners. We and our partners help and learn from each other in a bilateral exchange, not a unilateral movement of aid from us to them.\n- We are fallible, and in fact we will surely make mistakes. We create a space with safeguards and a culture that makes those mistakes okay.\n- We recognize that we need each other’s help, so we ask for help and encourage each other to do likewise.\n\n## Positive Impact\n\n- We commit to ensuring our work has a positive impact for people who need it.\n- We are mindful of the impact our work has, and we accept responsibility for that impact, both good and bad, intentional and unintentional.\n\n## Accountability\n\n- Our partners rely on us, and we rely on each other. Therefore, we accept the responsibility to deliver what we promise.\n- We hold ourselves accountable to each other, our partners, and our community for the impacts of our choices.\n- We clearly communicate our expectations and capabilities to each other and our partners.\n\n## Self-Care\n\n- We understand that we cannot effectively work with our partners unless we also care for each other and ourselves.\n- We make time to care for each other and ourselves.\n- We recognize that we all need to practice self-care, so we encourage and support each other in practicing it.\n\n# Addressing Failures and Improving our Culture\n\nWe are always striving to improve our culture, and suggestions from you about how we can improve or areas where we are failing are important to us. Similarly, we want to hear about any concerns you have regarding actions or situations that contravene these values. Please direct these suggestions and concerns to any of the following:\n- Club Leadership: Contact information at https://codethechange.stanford.edu\n- The Haas Center: haascenter@stanford.edu\n- Stanford’s Office of Community Standards: community-standards@stanford.edu\n\nIf you report to club leadership, we promise that we will do the following:\n- We will keep your report confidential. We may have to share your report to address your concerns, for example with other members of club leadership to decide how to respond, with Stanford University, or with law enforcement, but we value your privacy and will work to protect it.\n- We will work swiftly to address any failings or areas of improvement you report to us.\n- If you like, we will include you as much as possible in our work to respond to your report. In some cases we may not be able to share the details of our response with you, but we will share what we can.\n\nFor example, if you are concerned that one of our projects may harm someone, please let us know. Such a harm runs contrary to our *Positive Impact* value, and we will take corrective action. Similarly, we don’t want anyone to feel excluded from our community, as exclusion runs contrary to our *Community* value, so we work to make our community welcoming for everyone.

This is hardly exhaustive, but we hope it helps illustrate our goals.\n\n# Absolutely Necessary\n\nThese are non-negotiable. Without exception, each partner and project must clearly meet each of these criteria.\n\n* Our partners must act ethically and legally.\n* Our work on the project and with the partner must comply with any applicable regulations, including the Stanford Administrative Guide and local, state, and federal law.\n    * For example, foreign partners must not be in countries where sanctions forbid our work.\n\n# Very Important\n\nWe think very carefully before working on any project where these criteria might not be met. Exceptions are possible, but only with caution.\n\n* Partners should be responsive to team leads and engaged in guiding our work on the project.\n\n* Working on the project should not expose contributors to risks that are unreasonable given contributors’ positions as student volunteers.\n\n    * For example, work that exposes contributors to potential criminal or civil liability (e.g. work with protected health information or trade secrets) should be avoided.\n\n* Any mistakes by contributors should not endanger anyone’s safety.\n\n    * If work is on projects critical to life or safety (e.g. work on implanted medical devices), safeguards (e.g. code reviews) should be in place to catch any errors. Contributors are students, and mistakes should be expected.\n\n* Partners should be non-profits or otherwise have a legal structure that prioritizes the charitable mission.\n\n    * In general, we do not work with for-profit organizations, but we are fine partnering with public benefit corporations.\n\n    * More generally, it should be clear that contributors’ work will go entirely to support the charitable mission.\n\n* Organizations should be in need of contributions.\n\n    * For example, consider the following scenario. We contribute to a project, so the partner does not have to hire a developer to develop the project. Instead, the partner uses that money to give its well-paid CEO a bonus. In this case, our work essentially gave the CEO an unnecessary bonus, which is not a charitable cause.\n\n* Projects should have an appropriate scope. The quantity and effectiveness of work varies by team, but a rough estimate is that each project will be worked-on by a team of 1-3 for 6 hours a week for 7 weeks in each of Stanford’s 3 academic quarters. We should be able to contribute an impactful part of the overall project within that time.\n\n* Projects should require relatively little esoteric knowledge. For any needed knowledge not covered in the first couple introductory college computer science courses, assume that contributors will need to learn it on their own. This learning should be doable.\n\n    * Note that many contributors will come in with little experience with front-end development. In particular, our introductory computer science classes do not cover web or mobile app development. Contributors can absolutely learn these skills, but it will take time that should be accounted for in project scope.\n\n* Projects should be impactful. Our contributions should, as directly as possible, make life better for some group of people in need. Contributions are essentially donations of time and effort, so like with monetary donations, we want to make sure our donations are going to good causes.\n\n# Preferable\n\nThese are the criteria we look for to find good projects.\n\n* We like projects whose source code is publicly available under an open-source license (a license approved by the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/)).\n\n* We like projects that utilize technologies that are either likely to be familiar to contributors or are likely to be useful for contributors in the near future.\n\n    * Even though contributors are likely to be unfamiliar with web development, web development frameworks are useful to learn, so these frameworks can make a project more appealing.\n\n* We like mature projects that have clear, concrete goals and a plentiful supply of starter tasks.\n\n    * Starter tasks are important for the onboarding process.\n\n    * In our experience, vague projects tend to struggle, while concrete ones tend to flourish.\n\n* We like projects that are backed by established, stable organizations.\n\n    * This helps us see that the project will be supported in the long term.\n\n* We like projects that have already demonstrated some impact (e.g. number of users, trees saved, etc.)\n\n    * This validates our belief that our work will be impactful.\n\n# Icing on the Cake\n\nThese are great to have, but not needed for the project to be a good one.\n\n* We love it when partners are be willing to mentor contributors, for example through code reviews.\n\n* It’s great when the project is open to and welcoming of new contributors from the open source community.\n"}})],1)])])},be=[function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement,o=e._self._c||t;return o("div",{staticClass:"intro"},[o("h1",{attrs:{id:"hook"}},[e._v("Partner Criteria")]),o("p",{staticClass:"hook-sub"},[e._v(" Interested in partnering with us?

[Join!](http://codethechange.stanford.edu/#/join)\n2. Once we add you to the Slack, join the `#oppia-new` channel and say hi!\n\n## Get Setup with Oppia\n\n1. Sign the [CLA](https://goo.gl/forms/AttNH80OV0). We know it's annoying, but the Oppia organization requires that all contributors have signed a CLA.\n2. Complete the [Oppia contributor survey](https://goo.gl/forms/otv30JV3Ihv0dT3C3) to help the team at Oppia get to know you. This helps them find projects that you might be interested in.\n3. Make sure you have 2-factor authentication enabled on your GitHub account. This is required by Oppia. Instructions can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/). Afterwards, you might need to [create an access token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/) to access your account from the command line.\n4. Join the [oppia-dev@ mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/oppia-dev) and the [gitter](https://gitter.im/oppia/oppia-chat). The gitter is a great place to ask questions!\n\n# Getting Help\n\nAs you work through the steps in this guide, you'll probably run into problems or have questions. Please reach out when this happens; we want to help! Your feedback also helps us improve this guide for future contributors. Here are some ways to get help:\n\n* Message in the `#oppia-new` slack channel\n* Email the team leadership\n* Ask in the Oppia gitter\n\n# Setup Your Development Environment\n\n1. Create a new folder to store your Oppia work. For the purposes of this guide, we'll assume you created a folder named `opensource` in your home folder (`~/opensource` where the `~` is an abbreviation for your home directory).\n2. Navigate to the [Oppia GitHub repository](https://www.github.com/oppia/oppia) and click `Fork`. Sign in to your GitHub account if prompted. Once the forking is complete, go to `github.com/[yourGitHubUsername]/oppia`, where the fork operation just created a copy of the Oppia repository for you.\n    * What Forking Does: When you fork the Oppia repository, you create a copy of it that you own and have full access to. Instead of changing the main Oppia repository, which you don't have access to yet, you can change your own copy and then ask (using what's called a pull request) to send those changes back to the main repository.\n3. In the terminal, navigate to the `opensource` directory (folder) you created earlier. You can do this by running `cd ~/opensource`. Then get a copy of your fork of the Oppia repository like this:\n\n   ```\n   $ git clone https://github.com/[yourGitHubUsername]/oppia.git\n   ```\n\n   replacing `[yourGitHubUsername]` with your actual username. This will clone (download) your fork to `~/opensource/oppia`.\n4. In the terminal navigate to the Oppia repository you cloned. You can do this by running `cd ~/opensource/oppia`. Then add the main oppia repository as a remote named `upstream` like this:\n\n   ```\n   $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/oppia/oppia.git\n   ```\n\n   This will let you update your fork with changes from the main repository.\n5. Follow the installation instructions in Oppia's wiki for your platform: [Linux](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Installing-Oppia-%28Linux%29), [macOS](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Installing-Oppia-%28Mac-OS%29), and [Windows](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Installing-Oppia-%28Windows%29).\n    * Except for where a command in the installation instructions includes `sudo`, don't use `sudo` during the installation. It's not necessary! If you are running into permission issues, ask us for help.\n    * If you run into problems, [here](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/wiki/Issues-with-installation%3F) are some troubleshooting tips.\n\n# Get Started Learning the Technologies Oppia Uses\n\nIf you aren't familiar with the following technologies, we strongly encourage you to check out some of the listed resources to develop a basic understanding. We don't expect anyone to become an expert in these technologies before starting, but having seen the basics will help you get started. We suggest spending no more than a couple hours learning each new topic, and many will be much faster!\n\n* Git: Git is a tool for managing many different versions of a file and the history of changes that have been made to it. It is commonly used by software developers to track different versions of their code. Our very own Drew Gregory created a tutorial to introduce you to using git, which you can find [here](https://stanford-code-the-change-guides.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide_git.html).\n* HTML: HTML is a language used across the web to style the text on webpages. Further, it often defines the basic framework within which the rest of a site is constructed. Mozilla has a [guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML) you can check out.\n* Javascript: Javascript implements the logic in many websites. Mozilla has a [guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics) you can use, but don't worry about learning much more than the very elementary here because Oppia uses AngularJS instead of using plain Javascript. However, knowing a bit of Javascript will make it much easier to learn AngularJS.\n* AngularJS (v1): AngularJS is a framework that makes writing Javascript easier. We recommend the [official tutorial](https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/index), and Oppia also recommends [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO1ROKMjPqI&list=PLvZkOAgBYrsS_ugyamsNpCgLSmtIXZGiz). Oppia's frontend is written in AngularJS, and there are more projects available in the frontend than the backend. Thus, we highly recommend developing your AngularJS knowledge, even if you already know Oppia's backend languages.\n\nBackend (python) and developer tooling (bash) projects are available, but there aren't as many. This is why we recommend learning AngularJS.\n\n# Starter Issues\n\nAt this point, you should be able to run the Oppia site locally on your computer, and you should have a basic understanding of Git, HTML, and AngularJS. For starter issues, check out [our trello](https://trello.com/b/ScAy6Mu5/oppia). Let us know what you'd like to work on, and we'll reserve that issue for you. If nothing there strikes your fancy, take a look at the pinned issues at the top of the [Oppia issues page](https://github.com/oppia/oppia/issues).\n\n        "}})],1)])])},Te=[function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement,o=e._self._c||t;return o("div",{staticClass:"intro"},[o("h1",{attrs:{id:"hook"}},[e._v("Oppia Getting Started Guide for Coders")]),o("p",{staticClass:"hook-sub"},[e._v(" Welcome!

As part of your first task, you will create a simple tic-tac-toe game in a JavaScript-supported browser. We won’t require you to use a specific framework, but the following guide will strongly emphasize the use of React with Hooks.\n\nPlease join the `#start-the-change` channel on Slack. Here you'll be able to ask questions about the project, get help, and see other members' questions. We encourage you to answer questions in that channel too!\n\n## Our Goals\n\nWe hope that creating this game helps introduce you to what Code the Change is all about, starts to build your familiarity with web development, and gives you practice with troubleshooting. We also hope that you'll have fun building it! We also look forward to seeing what you create. At the end of your project, you will show us what you built to give us a better understanding of what your background and interests are.\n\nNow, we want to be very clear that this starter project is not a coding challenge like those used by companies to screen job applicants. **Your performance on the starter project does not affect whether you can join Code the Change or what opportunities are available to you.** This project is about you learning and us getting to know you, not us evaluating you.\n\n## Project Specification\n\nAt the end of this project, you should have a functioning, browser-based tic-tac-toe game that lets two players place their markers in turn. Note that the players can be on the same browser session so that your game can run as a static site. Once a player wins, the game should say so. For example:\n\n<img src='./assets/starter/progress_functional_game.gif' alt='A tic-tac-toe game being played.' width='500em'>\n\nIn addition, we strongly encourage you to expand on this core game with a more aesthetically appealing interface or additional functionality. This guide provides one example of each.\n\nThe rest of this guide walks you through one way of building this game, which you are welcome to follow. However, we encourage you to experiment and surprise us with what you come up with! Code the Change involves a lot of self-directed problem solving and creativity, so you'll get a better picture of what Code the Change is all about if you deviate from this guide a little and explore on your own.\n\nOnce you're done with your app, you will upload your code to GitHub and deploy your game to the web. More detailed instructions are at the end of this guide. Once you finish, reach out to the club leaders so we can help find a project that matches your interests and experience.\n\n## What is React?\n\nReact is a powerful and versatile JavaScript framework created by Facebook that enables developers to build their user interface and functionality as reusable components. In our case, we will build a tic-tac-toe game using 3 components: one for the squares, one for the board, and another for the complete game logic.\n\nIn React, there are two types of components: class components and functional components. If you’re interested in the differences between the two, take a look at this article [here](https://medium.com/@Zwenza/functional-vs-class-components-in-react-231e3fbd7108). The relevant difference here is that functional components are stateless, which makes it difficult to change behavior dynamically within a component. While class components can set its own state, creating a class requires writing more code.\n\nLuckily, with the recent introduction of [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), there is now a way to set state within your functional components. Our implementation was written with Hooks, but feel free to use normal class components as well.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nPlease clone the [repository for the starter code](https://github.com/codethechange/code-the-change-starter-2020) and follow the setup instructions in `README.md`. Most (if not all) of your code will be written in the src folder. The files that we expect you to need are `components/Square.js`, `components/Board.js`, `components/Game.js`, `calculate_win.js`, and `index.css`. Nonetheless, feel free to add helper files.\n\nIf you have trouble at any point throughout this process, please reach out! Part of this task will be to learn how to ask for help and find the right questions to ask. Regardless of your experience with software development, you may find some aspects of these projects difficult. It is totally normal to hit roadblocks on the road to completion, and we want to make sure that you get over the finish line. Good luck!\n\n# Core Project\n\n## Setting Up a Square\n\nAs an initial step, we’ll need to create the most basic building block of our program–the square.\n\n* First, create a new CSS class called `squares` in `index.css`. This class should define a square’s background color, border, font size, etc. You may use the following CSS properties, but feel free to experiment and add/remove things.\n    * Our basic program will use the same properties for X and O values, but feel free to add classes such as `X` and `O` that have different properties depending on the value (like fonts and colors).\n    * **Note**: For font sizes, always aim to use relative units that depend on browser or HTML-wide font settings such as `em` and `rem` over fixed units like `px`. We will primarily be using `rem` here for its simplicity but if you are interested in understanding the differences between `em` and `rem` a bit more, check out this [blog post](https://zellwk.com/blog/rem-vs-em/)!\n  ```\n  .squares {\n    background: white;\n    color: black;\n    border: none;\n    font-size: 5rem;\n    cursor: pointer;\n    outline: none;\n  }\n  ```\n* Within `components/Square.js`, pass two parameters within your Square component, `value` and `onClick`. `value` will correspond to the current value of the square (“X”, “O”, or null), while `onClick` will be the function that determines what your program should do when a square is clicked.\n* In your return block, create a button with `squares` as the `className` attribute along with `onClick` as the `onClick` attribute. Let `value` be the element that appears in the button.\n    * To get you started, your button should come in the form `<button className=... onClick=...>...</button>`\n    * **Note**: When embedding JavaScript (JS) code within a JSX file, always use curly braces around the code being executed. In this example, `onClick` should be passed in as `{onClick}` and `value` should be passed in as `{value}` (squares can be passed in as a regular string since it is not a JS variable).\n        * JSX is a React-specific syntax extension that combines markup syntax (like HTML) with JavaScript code syntax. If you would like to know more, visit the official React documentation [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html).\n\nGreat job so far! If you want to render your progress at this point, feel free to do so by adding a `Square` component in the return block of `components/Game.js`. To do this, you’ll have to import the `Square` component within that file via `import Square from './Square'`. After assigning an arbitrary string to value (like 'X' or 'O') and an arbitrary function to `onClick`, add the following:\n\n```html\n<Square value={square} onClick={() => onClick()} />\n```\n\n<img src='./assets/starter/progress_single_x.png' alt='A screen with a single X at the center top.' width='500em'>\n\n## Setting Up the Board\n\nNow that we have the ability to render squares via the `Square` component, our next step is to create a new `Board` component that will lay out our squares in a 3x3 tic-tac-toe grid.\n\n* To simplify things, we have added a `board` class in `index.css` that will nicely format the tic-tac-toe squares in a grid format. Feel free to play around with this if you’re interested, but you don’t need to change it for the game to work.\n    * You may have noticed that we’re using the `fr` unit in `grid-template`. This is a unit that enables us to create elements of equal size, so `repeat(3, 1fr)` creates three elements that each take up a third of the available space.\n* Within `components/Board.js`, pass two parameters within your `Square` component, `squares` and `onClick` (sound familiar? We did something similar in `Square.js.`). Assume that `squares` is an array that contains nine square values ordered by their position on the board. `onClick` will be the function that determines what your program should do when a square is clicked.  We will implement this `onClick` function when setting up the `Game` component, but for now, assume that it accepts one parameter, `i`–the index of the square (see figure below).\n\n  <img src='./assets/starter/board_indices.png' alt='A 3-by-3 grid, with each square numbered 0-8 in row-major order.' width='500em'>\n\n* Within the same file, replace the empty tag (``<></>``) with a `div` tag using `board` as a `className` attribute. Within the body of this tag, render an array of `Square` components, each with their own unique key attribute corresponding to their index `i`, in addition to the value and `onClick` attributes. (**Hint**: to create this array, consider using the `map()` method outlined [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map).)\n    * To get you started, your div should come in the form `<div className=....>...</div>`\n    * Your `onClick` attribute should come in the form `{() => onClick(i)}`, rather than `{onClick(i)}`. The main difference between these two forms is that the former is telling the `onClick` attribute to execute `onClick(i)` when the component is clicked, while the latter invokes `onClick(i)` when it is assigned to the attribute; one is treated as a function, the other is treated as an object.\n\nAlmost there! Once again, if you would like to visually track your progress at this point, add a `Board` component in the return block of `components/Game.js`.\n\n<img src='./assets/starter/progress_grid.png' alt='Screen with a 3-by-3 grid.' width='500em'>\n\n## Setting up the Game\n\nWith our newly created `Board` component, we can render a tic-tac-toe grid equipped with the ability to display values and exhibit certain behavior when one of its squares is clicked. However, we still need to go one level higher and design a `Game` component that is responsible for controlling the board and other components beyond it. Going through this step might take a while, so we’ll split this process into several parts.\n\n### Initializing States\n\nIf we’re going to create a functional tic-tac-toe game, how are we going to keep track of all of the values on the board, whether X or O is next, step number, and other key variables? We’ll want to re-render the entire screen whenever a state change occurs, which is exactly why we’re using `state` variables here over normal instance variables.\n\n* In Hooks, setting up state is easy; we’ll need to create the variables themselves along with their corresponding setters. For helpful documentation, check out [this introduction to Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).\n    * The first state we’ll want to keep track of is `board`, which is an array of size 9 that tracks the value of each square ('X', 'O', or null/empty string). Create `board` along with its setter `setBoard`, where `board` is initially an array of 9 null values.\n    * Next, we’ll want to keep track of `stepNumber`, which is a zero-indexed value indicating how many turns have been taken before the current turn. Create `stepNumber` along with its setter `setStepNumber`, where `stepNumber` is initially 0.\n    * Finally, for our last state variable, we’ll create `xIsNext`, which is a boolean that will determine whether it is X’s turn or not.  Create `xIsNext` along with its setter `setXisNext`, where `xIsNext` is initially true.\n\n### Initializing Other Variables\n\nAlthough state is important, normal JavaScript variables still have a place within our program. These variables are computed every time our screen is re-rendered (that is, when the state changes).\n\n* We’ll be creating two variables that are part of this section, one of which will be the result of an imported function. As part of this task, you will be writing this function as well.\n    * First, create a variable that calculates the current winner of the board by passing in the return value from `calculateWinner()`. The winner can be X, O, or null (if there is no current winner).\n        * We’ll leave the details of implementing `calculateWinner()` up to you.\n    * Next, create a variable that either holds the string 'X' or 'O' depending on whether X is next or not. This is the string that will be passed into the board when the current player chooses a square.\n\n### Creating Helper Functions\n\nAs part of our program’s functionality, we need to have functions that enable us to click on a specific square, return to the start of a new game, and display the current game result. In this section, we will go over a few helpful pointers that you’ll need to write these functions. As far as styling goes, we recommend that you use arrow functions (more information [here](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/es6/javascript-arrow-function/)).\n\n* Create a function called `handleClick` with one parameter–the index of the square that is being clicked. This function should prevent an action from being taken if a winner has already been determined and/or that square has been taken. Otherwise, make sure that the right value is passed into the chosen square and change the player from X to O (or vice versa).\n    * As you might be guessing at this point, `handleClick` is the `onClick` function that will be passed into our `Board` component (more on that later).\n* Create a function called `jumpToStart` with no parameters; this should reset the board and bring the game back to the starting state.\n* Finally, create a function called `result` which will return a different string depending on the current state.\n    * If a winner is found, return the string `Winner: <winner>` where `<winner>` is either X or O.\n    * If there is a tie game, return the string `Tie Game`.\n    * Otherwise, return the string `Next Player: <player>` where `<player>` is either X or O.\n\n### Rendering the Components\n\n* Now that we have all of our variables and functions set up, let’s go ahead and render a working version of our program that incorporates everything we’ve done (we’ll let you fill in the blanks):\n\n  ```html\n  <>\n      <h1>Tic Tac Toe</h1>\n      <Board squares={...} onClick={...} />\n      <div className='info-wrapper'>\n          <div>\n            <button onClick={...}>Go to Start</button>\n          </div>\n          <h3>{...}</h3>\n      </div>\n  </>\n  ```\n* I created a new `info-wrapper` class in order to render the `<div>` and `<h3>` elements with maximum space between the two (see note below), in addition to doing some other CSS formatting with the buttons and text.\n    * **Note**: To layout your elements in an easy and dynamic way, consider using Flexbox. It is a powerful CSS layout tool that enables you to position and format your elements without explicitly defining their positioning. In the `info-wrapper` class above, we used space-between to create a gap between the `<div>` and `<h3>` elements.  You can also find an example of Flexbox being used in the starter code.\n* Now that you have rendered the components, you should see a functional tic-tac-toe game on the page. For guidance on how this should look, refer to the GIF below.\n\n<img src='./assets/starter/progress_functional_game.gif' alt='A tic-tac-toe game being played.' width='500em'>\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe hope you enjoyed this project guide! If you’ve come this far, then you’re more than ready to take on important non-profit work here at Code the Change. While it is almost impossible to categorize all of the fields of expertise needed to create successful software, we have found that most work (especially front-end development) falls into two buckets–design and functionality. We have offered two short bonus guides below so that you can explore each of these tracks further, and it is recommended that you try out at least one of the tracks that interests you. Nonetheless, if you’ve done everything up to this point then you have officially completed the project. Congratulations! 🎉\n\n# UI Design Track\n\nWelcome to the design track! Given how important design is to user experience and engineering quality, we’d like to show you a few ways to quickly improve the perceived quality of your product. In this section, we will focus primarily on `index.css` for the appearance of our tic-tac-toe game, but design is far more comprehensive than this. If you’re interested, be sure to read up on [this blog](https://djangostars.com/blog/ui-ux-terms-everyone-should-know/) to get a more in-depth view on what design is like.\n\n* Our first step will be to round the corners of our elements a bit. To do so, go to `index.css` and set the `border-radius` of the board to `1rem` and each of the squares to `0.5rem`. You might also want to consider setting the `border-radius` of the “Go to Start” button to be around `1.25rem`. For more examples of `border-radius` being used, check out the [official Mozilla Developer Network web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-radius).\n* Next, we are going to change the background and foreground colors to fit a more “Material Design” look. For every element in the foreground (text labels, buttons, squares, etc.) I used a light color like white (#FFFFFF) to complement the background’s dark blue color (#3171D6).\n    * CSS already stores `white` as a variable, but in order to use a custom hex color like #3171D6, it might make things easier to create a new CSS variable if you use it in multiple places. To do so, try putting the following at the top of `index.css`:\n      ```css\n      :root {\n        --style-color: #3171d6;\n      }\n      ```\n    * From here, you can change the colors of each of the necessary elements (site background, square background, and button text) by setting the `color` or `background-color` to be `var(--style-color)`.\n    * Similarly, you can change the color of the board/square borders, button color, and text to be white by using the variable `white`.\n        * To set the default text color within this webpage, place `color: white` in the `body` selector.\n* Lastly, we will add a few finishing touches by providing feedback to the user when a button is hovered or a valid square is clicked.\n    * To show that the “Go to Start” `info-wrapper` button is being hovered, we should change the button’s color from white to a light gray (#BFBFBF). To do so, use the following CSS:\n      ```css\n      .info-wrapper button:hover {\n        background: #bfbfbf;\n      }\n      ```\n    * The next step (but a trickier one) is to add a fade-in animation to a square when an ‘X’ or an ‘O’ is being placed. The easiest way to do this in CSS is to use the @keyframes rule. Since we want to add a fade-in animation, slowly bringing the element from 0% to 100% opacity, consider using the following CSS:\n      ```css\n      @keyframes fadeInOpacity {\n          0% {\n              opacity: 0;\n          }\n          100% {\n              opacity: 1;\n          }\n      }\n      ```\n        * First, you should create a separate class for the ‘X’ and ‘O’ text if you haven’t done so already. Then, if one of the squares is validly selected, you can pass it into the `className` attribute of the button along with `squares` within `components/Square.js`. Then, you can implement the following for that class:\n          ```css\n          .class {\n              opacity: 1;\n              animation-name: fadeInOpacity;\n              animation-iteration-count: 1;\n              animation-timing-function: ease-in;\n              animation-duration: 0.5s;\n          }\n          ```\n\n<img alt='White tic-tac-toe game on blue background being played.' src='./assets/starter/progress_ui_track_complete.gif' width='500em'>\n\nGreat job! If you’d like, feel free to play around more with the design aspect of this project. As mentioned previously, there are several other considerations when designing software, including aspects like dark mode support, accessibility, or mobile responsive design!\n\n# UI Functionality Track\n\nWelcome to the functionality track! The term ‘functionality’ can mean a lot of things, but we will define it to be the complement of design. In other words, we will focus on the internal software *implementation* of design, which is known to be the more ‘algorithmic’ aspect of software engineering. Within this track, we will implement a history stack of our tic-tac-toe game in `components/Game.js` so that we can go back to previous moves and board positions.\n\n* To start, we should replace the state that maintains the board positions, board, with a state that maintains history, a history of the board positions. In other words, our array of board positions will now be an array of arrays of board positions. Create `history` along with its setter `setHistory`, where `history` is initially an array containing one element: an array of 9 null values.\n* Notice that `calculateWinner` takes the entire board as input. However, now that we have replaced `board` with `history`, you should make sure to calculate the winner of the game by passing the current board as a parameter to `calculateWinner`. (**Hint**: At any point where `board` was used in this file, you’ll be able to replace it with `history[stepNumber]`. You won’t need to edit the `calculateWinner` function to make this work.)\n* Next, edit the `handleClick` function so that it also changes `history` instead of `board`. In addition to `history`, you will also have to add code that alters `stepNumber` as well.\n* Now that the user can jump to the board at any point in time (not just the start), consider changing the `jumpToStart()` function to `jumpTo(step)`, where `step` is a number between 0 and 8 that determines which previous turn the user would like to go back to. Here, you will have to alter the `stepNumber` and `xIsNext` states to ensure that the board state being returned to is accurate.\n* At this point, you should update the `result` function so that it passes in `history[stepNumber]` instead of `board`. No other changes should be needed in this function.\n* Finally, we should create a function `renderMoves` that populates the page with all of the valid `history` buttons. For instance, if a user chooses to click 'Go to Move #3', then `renderMoves` should render the buttons 'Go to Start', 'Go to Move #1', 'Go to Move #2', and 'Go to Move #3', such that each button jumps to the corresponding point in history. Other than knowing that this function should return a list of buttons, the details of this implementation is up to you. (Consider using the `map()` method on your `history` state.)\n* By the end, your return function (based on our implementation) will only need to replace the `<button onClick={...}>Go to Start</button>` part with the following:\n  ```html\n  <h3>History</h3>\n  {renderMoves()}\n  ```\n\nNice work! We hope you enjoyed implementing this advanced tic-tac-toe functionality. If you’re even more keen on improving your game, consider adding in features like computer AI, past game history, or quantum tic-tac-toe!\n\n<img alt='A tic-tac-toe game being played that tracks history.' src='./assets/starter/progress_func_track_complete.gif' width='500em'>\n\n# Deploying Your Code\n\n**Warning:** These instructions are a work in progress, but hopefully they point you in the right direction.\n\n## Upload to GitHub\n\nIf you haven't already, create a GitHub account.

href=\\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-suciu-57989571/\\">Andrew Suciu</a>, then president of Stanford Code the Change, to find a team of computer science students to design a prototype website as part of a Law School practicum course. Law students in the course, taught by Professor <a href=\\"https://law.stanford.edu/directory/paul-goldstein/\\">Paul Goldstein</a> and renowned expert on international copyright law, wanted to reduce rampant theft of copyrighted photos online (e.g. from Google Images) and introduce a new platform to enable frictionless licenses between users and owners of copyrighted photos and images. Code the Change was challenged with prototyping such a platform that would specifically address the needs of so-called “long-tail” users, such as independent or community organizations that publish a low volume of photos online.</p><p>Over the course of two quarters, a team of five Code the Change students led by Christopher Yeh developed a prototype website to demonstrate the photo licensing concepts developed in the Stanford Law School practicum. The website included a user system to record transaction history, integration with Stripe’s API for processing payments for photo licenses, and a search system for finding uploaded photos. The features can be seen in the screenshots below and explored live at <a href=\\"https://copyright-license.herokuapp.com/\\">https://copyright-license.herokuapp.com/</a></p><p>Because the website was only intended as a prototype and not a production server, the team decided to use free tools. The team chose to host the website on Heroku with uploaded images stored in an Amazon AWS S3 bucket. Data about the images and photo licenses were stored in a PostgreSQL database, also hosted by Heroku. The web server written in Python using the Flask library, including the Flask-Login extension for managing user logins. Finally, we used the Masonry.js javascript grid layout library in the front-end to display images in a responsive, tiled format. While some members of the team had some experience building websites (e.g. at the level of CS 142), almost everyone was learning how to use these technologies on-the-spot.</p><p>At the end of the two quarters, the team was proud to present its work to the Stanford Law School practicum course (LAW 414O), and the website was submitted to the U.S. Copyright Office in a report titled titled <a href=\\"https://law.stanford.edu/publications/a-low-cost-digital-licensing-platform-for-photographs-documentation-for-a-prototype/\\">“A Low-Cost Digital Licensing Platform for Photographs: Documentation for a Prototype”</a>.

However, our needs                     for the application warranted a complete overhaul of the codebase, which led us to implement the MERN Stack                    soon after. With our application running on MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js, we were able to create                    a streamlined, user-friendly web service capable of matching mentors to mentees based on their common                     characteristics.

Once we were comfortable with the direction of the user experience, our next duty was to translate that easy-to-digest UI into front-end code using React, Redux Forms, and Bootstrap. This process took several months given that much of our target demographic, migrants and refugees, have limited experience with computers. While working on the front-end, our team was also building a robust matching algorithm in JavaScript that is not only capable of providing great matches, but also good at handling edge cases (i.e. if no matches are found). Once a match was made, the largest task on the front-end was ensuring that this information was displayed concisely to the mentor and mentee. Meanwhile, some of our team started focusing more on the back-end/server-side aspect of the application, which mainly consisted of handling HTTP requests that could match users together and display the resulting information to the client. Although none of us had any form of training in backend development, we were able to learn using web resources and tinkering how to make our application to work properly.

Manna is distributed by the nonprofit Hedge 4 Humanity as a basic human right that every person in the world is eligible to receive, for free.                Founded in 2015, Manna has achieved milestones in the cryptocurrency movement, as the first blockchain-based currency to be created and distributed by a tax-exempt nonprofit organization, and the first digital currency to implement a Universal Basic Income as its primary method of distribution.                It currently distributes Manna weekly to about 100,000 users. The website is written in Vue.js with a Node.js server backend.            </p><br/><h3><b>The 2018-19 Year</b></h3><p>                To warm up to the codebase, we added two-factor authentication to <a href=\\"https://www.mannabase.com/\\">mannabase.com</a> as an added optional securiy measure.                We also added a settings page to allow the user to change their email, name, and password.            </p><p>                We aim for users to build a targeted direct giving portfolio so that users who want to participate in the UBI                but want to provide to others can allocate their weekly Manna to other causes and users of their choice.                We began by fleshing out a new dashboard page, profile pages for users, the ability to search for users, to add them as \\"connections\\",                and a new \\"Wallet\\" page that displays the user\'s transaction history in a more readable way. This work is currently under review.            </p><br/><h3><b>The 2019-20 Year</b></h3>            This year, Mannabase has become one branch of several in the parent nonprofit, Hedge 4 Humanity. We will be tackling several            initiatives:            <br/><br/><h4>BrightID</h4><p>                A global UBI can attract many spam accounts. This makes verifying the uniqueness of individual accounts                of utmost importance. Currently, users upon signup will be asked to send photos of their face and government id,                which is manually reviewed by Mannabase staff. This process does not scale well.            </p><p>                At the heart of this problem lies the challenge of validating unique identity.                How can one distinguish real accounts from fake ones? One approach is analyze connections between accounts                in a graph setting, much like how PageRank is used to validate the relevance/trustworthiness of web pages.                <a href=\\"https://brightid.org\\">BrightID</a> aims to do this with a mobile app for people to form connections with people they trust.                This app will contact a peer-to-peer network that will return scores that represent an individual account\'s trustworthiness.                These scores can then port to arbitrary applications.            </p>            Members of the Hedge 4 Humanity Team will be able to tackle a variety of different areas for BrightID, including:            <ul><li>The ability for a user to recover their connections if they lose their device.</li><li>The ability to flag users for removal from a group.</li><li>Peer-to-peer consensus functionaltiy between server nodes for the connection DB.</li><li>Anti-sybil algorithms and upgrading BrightID\'s security.</li></ul><br/><h4>Dollar For Everyone</h4><p>                Mannabase\'s Manna currency is quite speculative. Although its value may increase someday,                 we hope to also use a cryptocurrency at the moment with a more stable currency. That currency                 is DAI, which is a stable coin. It also has great infrastructure for <a href=\\"https://xdai.io/\\">burner wallets</a>                 that will allow users who are new to the cryptocurrency world easily participate and receive currency.                 The Dollar4Everyone project will be another UBI with this stablecoin, which can use BrightID to verify uniqueness                 of users. Members have the opporunity to also be intimately involved in building this project from scratch.            </p><br/><h4>Hedge 4 Humanity Website</h4><p>                Hedge 4 Humanity will be making a new website explaining the organization\'s structure and allowing for easy donation.                It will likely be partially implemented in Wordpress.

As an open source developer for Oppia, you will be interacting with programmers who have the same motivations as you all across the world, from India to Malaysia to the US.</p><p>Based on AngularJS and Python, Oppia is constantly improving its platform through direct feedback from the students, teachers, and volunteers. Oppia regularly tests its lessons with students around the world, and they conduct randomized trials to ensure their platform is effective. Therefore, you can rest assured that your contributions to Oppia are actually supporting students\' education around the world. Examples of future projects that you can work on include creating features to help teachers craft effective lessons, developing Oppia\'s Android application, improving the lesson feedback pipeline from the user to the teacher, and developing Oppia\'s testing and quality assurance infrastructure to make sure the platform is reliable for students.</p><p>If you would like to learn more, check out Oppia\'s <a href=\'https://github.com/oppia/oppia\'>GitHub</a> and <a href=\'https://oppia.org\'>website</a>.","organization":"Oppia is an online education platform that serves almost 430,000 students worldwide.

This will help NGOs and governments distribute aid to those migrant populations that need it most.</b></p><p>UNICEF receives anonymized and aggregated data describing daily movements of cell phones between cell towers. (Note that the data only count how many cell phones transitioned from one cell tower to another each day, so we cannot track individual phones.) Our tool uses maps and cell tower positions to estimate how many people move between any two political regions (e.g. provinces) each day.</p><p>To perform this estimation, we convert the provided migration data into a matrix. Then, we compute matrices that describe the fraction of each cell tower\'s range that is within each political region and that describe the fraction of each political region that is covered by each cell tower\'s range. Multiplying these three matrices yields the migration data between political regions. Efficiency was paramount since countries can have thousands of political regions. For example, the United States has over three thousand counties (Source: <a href=\\"https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/how-many-counties-are-there-united-states\\">USGS</a>). We relied on matrices in part because we optimized matrix operations using <a href=\\"https://www.numpy.org/\\">numpy</a>. We used an <a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-tree\\">RTree</a>, a geospatial data structure, to efficiently calculate the overlaps between polygons. This efficiency came from the RTree telling us which polygons had overlapping bounding boxes, drastically reducing the number of polygons we needed to consider. Combined, these optimizations let us perform our computations in a reasonable amount of time.</p><p>To make it easy for UNICEF to pick up our work once we finished, we emphasized having comprehensive documentation and unit tests as much as correctness. We also isolated the code that performs generally useful operations (e.g. computing polygon overlap) from the code that loads the data from files. This makes it easy to change the format of the data files--you only have to modify the isolated function that handles that particular file.</p><p>If you want to check out our work, take a look at our GitHub repository <a href=\\"https://github.com/codethechange/mobility_pipeline\\">here</a>.

These filters enable refugees and aid workers to bypass the vocational        and cultural barriers that arise with traditional language translation.      </p><p>        For the front-end work, we used React Native and Redux in order to populate the UI and maintain the application’s        state when users select certain filters. When a user selects the “Filters” button before searching for translators,        they are introduced to a pop-up modal that shows them a list of two types of filters: “hard” filters and “soft”        filters. Hard filters (e.g. medical or legal translating) are mandatory constraints that are guaranteed to be met        when connecting with a translator, while soft filters (e.g. urgent translator, translator from my organization)        are satisfied given certain constraints such as the number of translators available, the number of other soft        filters satisfied, etc.      </p><p>        Once we enabled the ability to select filters on the front-end, the next step was to create a REST API endpoint        that parses and sends these filters (in addition to other data) to the server for processing. From here, the final        step to select a sufficient number of filtered translators was to build a Python + Django microservice to fetch        translators from the database, algorithmically filter out the ineligible translators based on various parameters,        and then return the remaining translators back to the server. At this point, the final step entailed sending a        response back to the front-end, where the user could finally be matched with a translator based on the filters.      </p><p>        Overall, this was an excellent opportunity for us to learn about full-stack engineering, product planning (both        design-wise and algorithmically), and teamwork. Our Tarjimly project provided the right balance between having a        robust support structure and allowing for creative freedom. If this kind of project seems interesting to you, there        are several ongoing projects that we think you’d like!      </p>","organization":"Tarjimly","summary":"Tarjimly provides humanitarian assistance to refugees struggling with language barriers by connecting them with live translators.","team":["anthonyperez"],"wip":false,"year":"2020"},{"assets":[{"caption":"A current snapshot of HospitalRun\'s hospital information system.","src":"./assets/hospitalrun_dashboard.jpg"}],"background":"./assets/hospitalrun_logo.png","bullets":["HospitalRun is free, open source software that provides hospitals and other medical care facilities in the developing world with access to offline-first electronic health records and an easy-to-use hospital information system."],"featured":false,"icon":null,"name":"HospitalRun","narrative":"<p>For the upcoming school year, our focus will be on getting HospitalRun’s desktop and web React apps to version 2.0        (release build), which will be a significant improvement for current users compared to the beta build.      </p><p>        More on this prospective project coming soon!
