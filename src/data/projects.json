Law students in the course, taught by Professor <a href=\"https://law.stanford.edu/directory/paul-goldstein/\">Paul Goldstein</a> and renowned expert on international copyright law, wanted to reduce rampant theft of copyrighted photos online (e.g. from Google Images) and introduce a new platform to enable frictionless licenses between users and owners of copyrighted photos and images. Code the Change was challenged with prototyping such a platform that would specifically address the needs of so-called \u201clong-tail\u201d users, such as independent or community organizations that publish a low volume of photos online.</p><p>Over the course of two quarters, a team of five Code the Change students led by Christopher Yeh developed a prototype website to demonstrate the photo licensing concepts developed in the Stanford Law School practicum. The website included a user system to record transaction history, integration with Stripe\u2019s API for processing payments for photo licenses, and a search system for finding uploaded photos. The features can be seen in the screenshots below and explored live at <a href=\"https://copyright-license.herokuapp.com/\">https://copyright-license.herokuapp.com/</a></p><p>Because the website was only intended as a prototype and not a production server, the team decided to use free tools. The team chose to host the website on Heroku with uploaded images stored in an Amazon AWS S3 bucket. Data about the images and photo licenses were stored in a PostgreSQL database, also hosted by Heroku. The web server written in Python using the Flask library, including the Flask-Login extension for managing user logins. Finally, we used the Masonry.js javascript grid layout library in the front-end to display images in a responsive, tiled format. While some members of the team had some experience building websites (e.g. at the level of CS 142), almost everyone was learning how to use these technologies on-the-spot.</p><p>At the end of the two quarters, the team was proud to present its work to the Stanford Law School practicum course (LAW 414O), and the website was submitted to the U.S. Copyright Office in a report titled titled <a href=\"https://law.stanford.edu/publications/a-low-cost-digital-licensing-platform-for-photographs-documentation-for-a-prototype/\">\u201cA Low-Cost Digital Licensing Platform for Photographs: Documentation for a Prototype\u201d</a>.

CultureMesh is a public benefit corporation that has its own website and Android app. There have been about 1000 users over CultureMesh\u2019s lifetime, and we hope to grow this user base in a more iterative, data-driven way. To learn more about CultureMesh, be sure to check out its <a href=\"https://www.culturemesh.com\">website</a>.<p>Under the current design, CutlureMesh users join forums called \"Networks\" that consist of people who currently live in a given location (i.e. Palo Alto) and are from another location (i.e. France). Networks can also consist of people living in a location who speak a certain language (i.e. French). In these networks, people can create posts or events.</p></p><h3>Our Role</h3><p>Since CultureMesh is very small, CultureMesh currently depends on our Stanford Code the Change chapter to maintain the codebase. CultureMesh has an existing website, as well as Facebook Free Basics and Android apps (that Code the Change created last year), so this year\u2019s focus will be on refining all three to better serve user needs. We will be iterating on the existing products based on user feedback as the platform expands. The website is currently written with a PHP frontend and backend, and the Android app is written in Java with a Flask backend. The Facebook Free Basics app is written in Flask. We are currently considering development on all these fronts.</p><h3>Past Work</h3><h4>Android Application</h4><p>The Android application was natively developed in Android Studio. It current supports exploring popular locations for networks, creating posts, commenting on posts, creating events, and joining/leaving events.

However, our needs                     for the application warranted a complete overhaul of the codebase, which led us to implement the MERN Stack                    soon after. With our application running on MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js, we were able to create                    a streamlined, user-friendly web service capable of matching mentors to mentees based on their common                     characteristics. In the process, each of our team members developed first-hand experience with design,                     front-end, and back-end development.            </p><p>                Initially, our focus was on designing the UI by creating wireframes for each page layout. Once we were comfortable with the direction of the user experience, our next duty was to translate that easy-to-digest UI into front-end code using React, Redux Forms, and Bootstrap. This process took several months given that much of our target demographic, migrants and refugees, have limited experience with computers. While working on the front-end, our team was also building a robust matching algorithm in JavaScript that is not only capable of providing great matches, but also good at handling edge cases (i.e. if no matches are found). Once a match was made, the largest task on the front-end was ensuring that this information was displayed concisely to the mentor and mentee. Meanwhile, some of our team started focusing more on the back-end/server-side aspect of the application, which mainly consisted of handling HTTP requests that could match users together and display the resulting information to the client. Although none of us had any form of training in backend development, we were able to learn using web resources and tinkering how to make our application to work properly. Although this was a time consuming and stressful process, it ultimately taught us a lot and led us to create a usable and secure web app            </p><p>                Within seven months of starting the project, we had a working beta build that was ready for production.                 After thoroughly testing the build from the front-end to back-end, we are ready to deploy the application to Heroku,                which is when the Konexio team in Paris will utilize our web app in order to amplify the social impact they are creating                for underserved communities in France.            </p>",

Manna is distributed by the nonprofit Hedge 4 Humanity as a basic human right that every person in the world is eligible to receive, for free.                Founded in 2015, Manna has achieved milestones in the cryptocurrency movement, as the first blockchain-based currency to be created and distributed by a tax-exempt nonprofit organization, and the first digital currency to implement a Universal Basic Income as its primary method of distribution.                It currently distributes Manna weekly to about 100,000 users. The website is written in Vue.js with a Node.js server backend.            </p><br/><h3><b>The 2018-19 Year</b></h3><p>                To warm up to the codebase, we added two-factor authentication to <a href=\"https://www.mannabase.com/\">mannabase.com</a> as an added optional securiy measure.                We also added a settings page to allow the user to change their email, name, and password.            </p><p>                We aim for users to build a targeted direct giving portfolio so that users who want to participate in the UBI                but want to provide to others can allocate their weekly Manna to other causes and users of their choice.                We began by fleshing out a new dashboard page, profile pages for users, the ability to search for users, to add them as \"connections\",                and a new \"Wallet\" page that displays the user's transaction history in a more readable way. This work is currently under review.            </p><br/><h3><b>The 2019-20 Year</b></h3>            This year, Mannabase has become one branch of several in the parent nonprofit, Hedge 4 Humanity. We will be tackling several            initiatives:            <br/><br/><h4>BrightID</h4><p>                A global UBI can attract many spam accounts. This makes verifying the uniqueness of individual accounts                of utmost importance. Currently, users upon signup will be asked to send photos of their face and government id,                which is manually reviewed by Mannabase staff. This process does not scale well.            </p><p>                At the heart of this problem lies the challenge of validating unique identity.                How can one distinguish real accounts from fake ones? One approach is analyze connections between accounts                in a graph setting, much like how PageRank is used to validate the relevance/trustworthiness of web pages.                <a href=\"https://brightid.org\">BrightID</a> aims to do this with a mobile app for people to form connections with people they trust.                This app will contact a peer-to-peer network that will return scores that represent an individual account's trustworthiness.                These scores can then port to arbitrary applications.            </p>            Members of the Hedge 4 Humanity Team will be able to tackle a variety of different areas for BrightID, including:            <ul><li>The ability for a user to recover their connections if they lose their device.</li><li>The ability to flag users for removal from a group.</li><li>Peer-to-peer consensus functionaltiy between server nodes for the connection DB.</li><li>Anti-sybil algorithms and upgrading BrightID's security.</li></ul><br/><h4>Dollar For Everyone</h4><p>                Mannabase's Manna currency is quite speculative. Although its value may increase someday,                 we hope to also use a cryptocurrency at the moment with a more stable currency. That currency                 is DAI, which is a stable coin. It also has great infrastructure for <a href=\"https://xdai.io/\">burner wallets</a>                 that will allow users who are new to the cryptocurrency world easily participate and receive currency.                 The Dollar4Everyone project will be another UBI with this stablecoin, which can use BrightID to verify uniqueness                 of users. Members have the opporunity to also be intimately involved in building this project from scratch.            </p><br/><h4>Hedge 4 Humanity Website</h4><p>                Hedge 4 Humanity will be making a new website explaining the organization's structure and allowing for easy donation.                It will likely be partially implemented in Wordpress. There is already a developer working on this project, but members can also help with this development as well.</p>",

        "narrative": "<h3>Organization Description</h3><p><b>We developed a data processing tool that will help UNICEF monitor global human migration patterns. This will help NGOs and governments distribute aid to those migrant populations that need it most.</b></p><p>UNICEF receives anonymized and aggregated data describing daily movements of cell phones between cell towers. (Note that the data only count how many cell phones transitioned from one cell tower to another each day, so we cannot track individual phones.) Our tool uses maps and cell tower positions to estimate how many people move between any two political regions (e.g. provinces) each day.</p><p>To perform this estimation, we convert the provided migration data into a matrix. Then, we compute matrices that describe the fraction of each cell tower's range that is within each political region and that describe the fraction of each political region that is covered by each cell tower's range. Multiplying these three matrices yields the migration data between political regions. Efficiency was paramount since countries can have thousands of political regions. For example, the United States has over three thousand counties (Source: <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/how-many-counties-are-there-united-states\">USGS</a>). We relied on matrices in part because we optimized matrix operations using <a href=\"https://www.numpy.org/\">numpy</a>. We used an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-tree\">RTree</a>, a geospatial data structure, to efficiently calculate the overlaps between polygons. This efficiency came from the RTree telling us which polygons had overlapping bounding boxes, drastically reducing the number of polygons we needed to consider. Combined, these optimizations let us perform our computations in a reasonable amount of time.</p><p>To make it easy for UNICEF to pick up our work once we finished, we emphasized having comprehensive documentation and unit tests as much as correctness. We also isolated the code that performs generally useful operations (e.g. computing polygon overlap) from the code that loads the data from files. This makes it easy to change the format of the data files--you only have to modify the isolated function that handles that particular file.</p><p>If you want to check out our work, take a look at our GitHub repository <a href=\"https://github.com/codethechange/mobility_pipeline\">here</a>.

        "narrative": "<p>        During the 2019-2020 school year, we built a filtering system for Tarjimly so that users within the app can        search for translators with specific criteria such as professional expertise, phone interpretation, document        translation, and demographic preferences. These filters enable refugees and aid workers to bypass the vocational        and cultural barriers that arise with traditional language translation.      </p><p>        For the front-end work, we used React Native and Redux in order to populate the UI and maintain the application\u2019s        state when users select certain filters. When a user selects the \u201cFilters\u201d button before searching for translators,        they are introduced to a pop-up modal that shows them a list of two types of filters: \u201chard\u201d filters and \u201csoft\u201d        filters. Hard filters (e.g. medical or legal translating) are mandatory constraints that are guaranteed to be met        when connecting with a translator, while soft filters (e.g. urgent translator, translator from my organization)        are satisfied given certain constraints such as the number of translators available, the number of other soft        filters satisfied, etc.      </p><p>        Once we enabled the ability to select filters on the front-end, the next step was to create a REST API endpoint        that parses and sends these filters (in addition to other data) to the server for processing. From here, the final        step to select a sufficient number of filtered translators was to build a Python + Django microservice to fetch        translators from the database, algorithmically filter out the ineligible translators based on various parameters,        and then return the remaining translators back to the server. At this point, the final step entailed sending a        response back to the front-end, where the user could finally be matched with a translator based on the filters.      </p><p>        Overall, this was an excellent opportunity for us to learn about full-stack engineering, product planning (both        design-wise and algorithmically), and teamwork. Our Tarjimly project provided the right balance between having a        robust support structure and allowing for creative freedom. If this kind of project seems interesting to you, there        are several ongoing projects that we think you\u2019d like!      </p>",
